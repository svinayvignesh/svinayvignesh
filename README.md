# 👋 Yo, I'm Vinay

🎓 Grad student @ UNC Charlotte  
💼 **Hunting for full-time gigs** (hit me up if you're hiring!)  
🛠️ Full-stack dev who speaks **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **TypeScript**, **React**, and **Angular** fluently

---

## 🚀 The TL;DR

I build stuff that scales. From metadata platforms that make sense of chaos to tax websites that don't make you want to throw your computer out the window. My side projects? Everything from IoT sensors talking to Spring Boot backends to campus parking systems (because finding parking shouldn't require a CS degree).

- 🔭 Currently shipping **full-stack apps** with whatever tech stack makes sense (not just what's trendy)
- 🌱 Deep-diving into **system design** and **cloud architecture** (AWS doesn't scare me... much)
- 💡 Low-key obsessed with **data engineering**, **metadata management**, and making **IoT devices** do cool things
- 🎯 On the hunt for **Software Engineering**, **Full-Stack**, or **Backend** roles where I can actually make an impact

**Tax Website That Won't Give You a Headache** | `Next.js` `TypeScript` `React` `Tailwind CSS`
- Professional landing page for tax advisory services
- Contact form that actually sends emails (revolutionary, I know)

- Parking reservation system for UNCC campus
- Real-time availability tracking (no more driving around for 30 minutes)

## 🎯 What I'm Actually Looking For

Let's be real - I'm job hunting. Graduating soon and looking for companies that:

✅ Build **full-stack products** with modern tech (not legacy Java from 2005)  
✅ Need **backend engineers** who know their way around Spring Boot or Node.js  
✅ Have **data engineering** challenges (bonus if you need someone who understands metadata)  
✅ Actually care about **software craftsmanship** and clean code  
✅ Value **learning on the job** and won't freak out when I ask questions

Not interested in: Body shops, contract-to-maybe-hire-but-probably-not positions, or places where "Agile" means "chaotic."
