# 👋 HEY, I'm Vinay

▸ UNC Charlotte grad
⚡ Full-stack dev who speaks ++Java++, ++Spring Boot++, ++TypeScript++, ++React++, and ++Angular++ fluently

## 🔧 The TL;DR

I build stuff that scales. From metadata platforms that make sense of chaos to portfolio websites that don't make you want to throw your computer out the window. My side projects? Everything from IoT sensors running in Spring Boot backends to campus parking systems (because finding parking shouldn't require a CS degree).

- 🚀 Currently shipping ++full-stack apps++ with whatever tech stack makes sense (not just what's trendy)
- 🏗️ Deep-diving into ++system design++ and ++cloud architectures++ (AWS doesn't scare me... much)
- 🧮 Low-key obsessed with ++data engineering++, ++metadata management++, and making ++IoT devices++ do cool things
- 🔎 On the hunt for ++Software Engineering++, ++Full-Stack++, or ++Backend++ roles where I can actually make an impact
